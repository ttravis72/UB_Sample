I, Taylor Travis, have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor 
have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism I will 
have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my student’s 
records. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for all programming and theoretical 
assignments so that my maximum grade will be 60%.”
